AllCheckoutsSim.slx is a Simulink simulation of grocery store checkout lines. It uses Matlab, Simulink, and the SimEvents, Signal Processing Toolbox, and DSP System Toolbox packages of Matlab.

Make sure that you keep all of the files in the "All Checkouts Simulation" folder in that folder. To run the simulation, the .csv files and all of the Matlab files need to be in the same folder.

Instructions for Running:

0. Make sure you have Matlab, Simulink, the SimEvents package, the Signal Processing Toolbox package, and the DSP System Toolbox package installed.
1. Open SimulationParameters.m in Matlab
2. Set the variables at the top of the SimulationParameters.m file in Matlab.
3. Open AllCheckoutsSim.slx
4. open the Data Inspector in the AllCheckoutsSim file (to the right of the Run and Stop button)
5. Push Run to start the simulation. It will continue for 1,000,000 simulated seconds. It shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to finish running.
6. Sort the signals in the Data Inspector by name and click the checkboxes to view the signals.
